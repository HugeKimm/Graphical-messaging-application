# Graphical-messaging-application
This project sets up a messaging application using MQTT to publish and subscribe to messages, and Tkinter to manage the user interface. The functions allow publishing messages, subscribing to and unsubscribing from MQTT topics, and display the current messages and subscriptions in a graphical interface.

Installation

```http
pip install paho-mqtt
```
After installation, you can verify if the module is properly installed by opening a Python session and trying to import it:

``import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt``
